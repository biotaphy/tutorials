  CSV
    CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a file format for records, in which fields are
    separated by a delimiter.  Commas and tabs are common, but other characters may
    be used as delimiters.

  DwCA
    DwCA (Darwin Core Archive) is a packaged dataset of occurrence records in [Darwin
    Core standard](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/) format, along with metadata
    about the contents.

  Data Wrangler
    Data wranglers are types of specify-lmpy data modification tools for filtering or
    editing data using specified criteria or methods.

  Geospatial data
    Geospatial data is discussed in more detail [here](./spatial_data.rst)

  Matrix
    A Matrix is a multi-dimensional array of values.

  PAM
    A Presence-Absence Matrix (PAM) is a 2-dimensional Matrix of sites (rows) and
    species (columns) encoded as presence (1) or absence (0).

  Occurrence
    An occurrence is a record of a specimen occurrence including metadata about the
    specimen and the spatial location where it was found.

  Grid
    A grid (in this context) is a geospatial region represented as a contiguous set of
    square polygons (cells) to be used for matrix creation.  Grids are created as
    vector data, with one square polygon for every grid-cell, and stored in shapefile
    format.

  Species Distribution Model
    A species distribution model is a estimation of potential habitat for a particular
    species.

  Tree
    A Tree is a set of hierarchical data.  In this tutorial, our tree data is all
    phylogenetic data, and is represented in
    [Newick](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html) or
    [Nexus](http://wiki.christophchamp.com/index.php?title=NEXUS_file_format) format.
