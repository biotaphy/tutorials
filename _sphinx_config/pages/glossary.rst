  CSV
    CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a file format for records, in which fields are
    separated by a delimiter.  Commas and tabs are common, but other characters may
    be used as deliters.

  DwCA
    DwCA (Darwin Core Archive) is a packaged dataset of occurrence records in [Darwin
    Core standard](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/) format, along with metadata
    about the contents.

  Data Wrangler
    Data wranglers are types of specify-lmpy data modification tools for filtering or
    editing data using specified criteria or methods.

  Geospatial data
    Geospatial data is data with geographic location associated with it, i.e. map
    data.  There are two kinds of spatial data, Raster Data and Vector Data.  Each
    has properties that make it better for representing different information.

  Matrix
    A Matrix is a multi-dimensional array of values.

  PAM
    A Presence-Absence Matrix (PAM) is a 2-dimensional Matrix of sites (rows) and
    species (columns) encoded as presence (1) or absence (0).

  Occurrence
    An occurrence is a record of a specimen occurrence including metadata about the
    specimen and the spatial location where it was found.

  Grid
    A grid (in this context) is a geospatial region represented as a contiguous set of
    square polygons (cells) to be used for matrix creation.  Grids are created as
    vector data, in shapegrid format.

  Raster Data
    Geospatial data best represented in raster format generally has one value at
    every point.  The area to be represented is split up into a grid, with each
    grid cell containing a value. Elevation, temperature, precipitation are
    examples of data generally represented as raster.

  Species Distribution Model
    A species distribution model is a estimation of potential habitat for a particular
    species.

  Tree
    A Tree is a set of hierarchical data.  In this tutorial, our tree data is all
    phylogenetic data, and is represented in
    [Newick](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html) or
    [Nexus](http://wiki.christophchamp.com/index.php?title=NEXUS_file_format) format.
